PunAPI Python Script

This Python script interacts with the PunAPI, fetching a pun and displaying it in the console.
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x
    requests library. Install it via pip install requests.

How to Use

    1.Clone or download the repository.
    2.Install the required requests library using the following command:
    ```pip install requests```
    3.run the script
    ```python pun_api_script.py```
    This will display a random pun retrieved from the PunAPI.

Code Overview

The script uses the requests library to send a GET request to the PunAPI endpoint https://punapi.rest/api/pun. Upon a successful request, it fetches a pun and prints it to the console.
```
import requests

def fetch_pun():
    url = "https://punapi.rest/api/pun"
    
    response = requests.get(url)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        pun = response.json()['pun']
        return pun
    else:
        return "Failed to fetch pun from the API"

def main():
    pun = fetch_pun()
    print("Here's a pun for you:")
    print(pun)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    
```
